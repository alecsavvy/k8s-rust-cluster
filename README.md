# k8s-rust-cluster
Building out a self aware cluster with rust + minikube.

## things to do

1. build out minikube cluster
2. build node with lib-p2p that can passively discover each other within k8s
3. add in memory stores for nodes that can be referenced by decentralized data store (actix actor addresses?)
